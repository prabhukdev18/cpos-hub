# 🧑‍💻 Developer Code of Conduct

Welcome to CPOS. This code of conduct reflects how we work, how we build, and how we win — together.

---

## ✅ Quality and Attention to Detail

- We take pride in our work. Every line of code is a reflection of our craft.
- Code should be readable, maintainable, and tested. Aim for clarity over cleverness.
- Reviews aren’t gatekeeping — they’re collaboration. Ask questions, suggest improvements, and celebrate clean solutions.
- Pay attention to naming, formatting, and documentation. They are part of the product too.

## 🔒 Security as a Best Practice

- Security isn’t optional or an afterthought — it’s baked into every decision.
- Default to least privilege, validate all inputs, and never hardcode secrets.
- Stay up to date on security best practices and share what you learn.
- Treat user data like it’s your own. Protect it always.

## 🧠 Solve Problems First, Win Second

- Winning is great — but solving the right problem is better.
- Take time to understand the “why” before jumping into the “how.”
- Technical choices should serve the product, not egos.
- It’s okay to be wrong. It’s not okay to double down on wrongness.

---

## ⚡ Get Shit Done

- Progress beats perfection when perfection prevents progress.
- Don’t block yourself or others — find a path forward and communicate it.
- If something’s slowing you down, raise it early.
- Own your work from idea to execution. Take initiative, and follow through.

---

## 🧗 Level Each Other Up

- Feedback is a gift. Give it kindly. Receive it openly.
- Mentor generously. Learn constantly.
- Assume positive intent, but don’t shy away from hard conversations.
- We rise together. Make space for others to lead, grow, and shine.

Let’s build something great — one commit at a time.
